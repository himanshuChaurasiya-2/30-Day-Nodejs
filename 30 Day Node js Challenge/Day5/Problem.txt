		 Create a function 
		 checkFileExtension(filePath, expectedExtension)

		 as input. The function should check if the file has the 
		 expected extension using the path module and print the 
		 result to the console.

Function Signature:

		function checkFileExtension(filePath, expectedExtension) 
		{
    		// Implementation
		}

Expected Output:

		File has the expected extension: .txt
Test Cases:

		checkFileExtension('test-files/file1.txt', '.txt');
		// Expected Output: File has the expected extension: .txt

		checkFileExtension('test-files/image.png', '.jpg');
// Expected Output: File does not have the expected extension. Expected: .jpg, Actual: .png
